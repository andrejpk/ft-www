        Screen Printing is still a great way to get the right look, especially
        when you have a large run or want flexibility in your art and design. We
        also have digital printing and cut-vinyl for smaller runs and special
        art.

        Embroidery gives you a timeless look. It works especially well on polo
        shirts and to personalize items with names or monograms

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
